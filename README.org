~aorg-sync.sh~ synchronizes a remote archive.org item folder with the local directory.

It tries to minimize network traffic by checking file sizes, last modified times and
md5 hashes against item metadata exposed by archive.org.

* Usage

You can run this on the Mister or on another Linux host.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
cp aorg-sync.sh /media/fat/Scripts
mkdir -p /media/fat/games/AO486/0mhz && cd /media/fat/games/AO486/0mhz
/media/fat/Scripts/aorg-sync.sh # Will sync into /media/fat/games/AO486/0mhz
#+END_SRC

All user-configuration options can be overridden through the environment:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
REMOTE=foo ./aorg-sync.sh # Will sync https://archive.org/download/foo
#+END_SRC

If you're executing this script on macOS or another BSD, you'll need GNU coreutils
installed (e.g. from macports or homebrew) as the BSD versions of ~touch~ and
~stat~ do not support the same features.

If the script is reporting a ~self signed certificate in certificate chain~ error,
follow the directions shown [[https://boogermann.github.io/Bible_MiSTer/getting-started/how-to-use/#fixing-missing-certificates][here]] to install missing certificates,
or run the script with ~--no-check-cert~.
