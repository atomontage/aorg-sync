aorg-sync.sh synchronizes a remote archive.org item folder with the local directory.

It tries to minimize network traffic by checking file sizes, last modified times and
md5 hashes against item metadata exposed by archive.org.

* Usage

You can run this on the Mister or on another Linux host.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
cp aorg-sync.sh /media/fat/Scripts
mkdir -p /media/fat/games/AO486/0mhz && cd /media/fat/games/AO486/0mhz
/media/fat/Scripts/aorg-sync.sh # Will proceed to sync into /media/fat/games/AO486/0mhz
#+END_SRC

All user-configuration options can be overridden through the environment:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
REMOTE=foo aorg-sync.sh
#+END_SRC
